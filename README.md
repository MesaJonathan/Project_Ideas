# Project_Ideas
Project ideas that I've had and reasons why they were created, attempted or abandoned

## Fantasy Basketball Assistant
- Description: Application that would help make selection for drafting players in espn fantasy basketball league
- Status: Abandoned. The algorithm provided by ESPN is already so useful that an external tool is not worth making, however making a tool for daily substitutions could possibly be worth making

## Lofi Radio for Casual Coding
- Description: raspberry pi that plugs into CC projector through HDMI and streams Lofi video from youtube
- Status: Abandoned. We ended up switching rooms for casual coding and a pi to play music is no longer required since I can just sign on to the computer in the lecture hall

## Food app
- Description: uses whatever google maps api exists to show restaurants around. User can filter by type of food, pickup/delivery/dine-in, whats open. Like google maps but just restaurants.
- Status: Abandoned :(. Turns out google maps does have exactly what I wanted to make already implemented to the point where it's not worth it to remake it.
